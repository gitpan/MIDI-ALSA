This module offers a Perl interface to the ALSA library.  It is a
call-compatible translation into Perl of the Lua module midialsa
http://www.pjb.com.au/comp/lua/midialsa.html which is in turn based
on the Python modules alsaseq.py and alsamidi.py by Patricio Paez.

It also offers some functions to translate events from and to the
event format used in Sean Burke's MIDI-Perl module.

Nothing is exported by default, but all the functions and constants
can be exported, e.g.:
 use MIDI::ALSA(client, connectfrom, connectto, id, input, output);

The event-type constants, beginning with SND_SEQ_, are available
not as scalars, but as module subroutines with empty prototypes.
They must therefore be used without a dollar-sign e.g.:
 if ($event[0] == MIDI::ALSA::SND_SEQ_EVENT_PORT_UNSUBSCRIBED) { ...

To install:
	perl Makefile.PL; make; make install
